Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Mar. It is offended.
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
e
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe

Hor. As thou art to thyself.

Mar. Is it not like the King?

With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!

Of mine own eyes.
Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,

What think you on't?
Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
Exit Ghost.

Ber. See, it stalks away!
Is not this something more than fantasy?
